description: "Today I am updating my personal site. A site redesign was sometime I always imagined I would do when work dried up, but i have been priviledged to have stayed booked months in advance.

Each year, I spend the holidays playing with a redesign, but this year I am commited to working more iteratively and delivering more continuously. In that same spirit, I added a timeline feature to allow me to catalogue ouput from my disparate creative outlets and endeavors."
