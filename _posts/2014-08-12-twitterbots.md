A twitterbot is more-or-less an automated text generator that spews spam, poetry, or interacts with other twitter users. I built my twitterbots, @WritingAssnBot  &  @MakesTheHeart, using Python. 

## WRITING ASSIGNMENT BOT

{tweets}

@WritingAssnBot uses a mad-lib style algorithm to formulate writing assignments every hour on the hour. Give it a follow and you'll soon be knee deep with things to write about.


## MAKES THE HEART GROW BOT

{tweets}

@MakesTheHeart pulls words from two gigantic word lists composed of nouns and adjectives which then complete {noun} makes the heart grow {adjective}.
