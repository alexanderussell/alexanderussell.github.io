CourseCheck is a small proof-of-concept built for the ITS department at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln.

The ITS department is planning to undergo a university wide transition from blackboard to canvas LMS. During the transition, ITS wants to try to downsize the amount of storage that each course uses up. To do this, they set limits on file sizes and identified other file types that would take up excessive space.

We built them CourseCheck. It's a tiny electon app that can live on a user's desktop. You download your course file from blackboard and use the app to identify the course file. The app identifies the issues and presents the user with the file name, location, and potential problems they may have when transitioning to canvas. Instructors use this tool to make edits to their files to ensure a smooth and painless transition to the new system.
