Course Check is a small proof-of-concept built for the ITS department at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln.

The ITS department is planning to undergo a university wide transition from blackboard to canvas LMS. During the transition, ITS wants to try to downsize the amount of storage that each course uses up. To do this, they set limits on file sizes and identified other file types that would take up excessive space.

We built them Course Check. It's a tiny electon app that can live on a user's desktop. You download your course file from blackboard and use the app to identify the course file. It scans your files and flags each one with potential problems.
