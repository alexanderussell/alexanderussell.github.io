We determined that most users are going to be new users as opposed to returning. So the most appropriate place for a user to land when accessing the site was the page that explained what We Are Vital actually is. The copy from the 'about' page became the home page and the acutal copy was used as navigation into the site.

The site's pages are pretty shallow. Every interior page has a specific goal of giving the user access to resources to stay informed or participate. All of the design is stripped 

The site's aesthetics fall under the genre of 'urban sketching'. I had long been experimenting with  Hand-drawn because the neighborhood is hand-drawn.

The site was built using Jekyll in order to house it on Github Pages. There are few benefits to this:

1. Github Pages hosting is free so long as the organization or user keeps their code in a public repository. Housing the We Are Vital code in an open-source space follows suit with We Are Vital's transparent philosophy. It's built on top of an open-source framework called <a href="https://github.com/mrmrs/nkd">NKD</a>, again following suit with the core philosophy of building collectively.

2. Creating a Github organization allows us to offer a space for other programmers to utilize their skills in building things for the community or just building things in the community. It's a space for us.

3. Jekyll is lightweight. The We Are Vital site is designed to deliver information and direct people to pertinent pages or newsletters to keep them informed. Static pages and minimal stylesheets equate to quick loadtimes which means visitors can get information they need effectively.
