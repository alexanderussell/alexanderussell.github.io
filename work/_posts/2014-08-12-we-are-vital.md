The description was something along the lines of:

> "We Are Vital is like Ken Robinson and the Renters Association is Obama's Education plan"



it was easy  Hand-drawn because the neighborhood is hand-drawn.

The site was built using Jekyll in order to house it on Github Pages. There are few benefits to this:

1. Github Pages hosting is free so long as the organization or user keeps their code in a public repository. Housing the We Are Vital code in an open-source space follows suit with the transparent philosophy that We Are Vital follows. It's built on top of an open-source framework called <a href="https://github.com/mrmrs/nkd">NKD</a>, again following suit with the core philosophy of building collectively.

2. Creating a Github organization allows us to offer a space for other programmers to utilize their skills in building things for the community or just building things in the community. It's a space for us.

3. Jekyll is lightweight. The We Are Vital site is designed to deliver information and direct people to pertinent pages or newsletters to keep them informed.
