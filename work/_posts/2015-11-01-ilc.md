Integrated Life Choices approached us with a very archaic way of handling their records. ILC hires direct service professionals to live with those who need care. In order to maintain the quality of care they offer, they have supervisors and area directors fill out quality assurance forms. These forms have a variety of questions that can be answered simply with 'yes' or 'no'. for example:

QIS staff need the ability to view the performance of locations to make informed decisions about improving their quality. To do that we created a system that would aggregate the submissions collected, allowing staff to measure areas against each other and against time. Because most questions are Yes or No questions, we can measure quality of service by looking at the percent of ‘yes’ answers given.
