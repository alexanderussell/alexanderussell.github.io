<!-- This site is an attempt to produce a personal website that curates output from a multitude of creative outlets and endeavors. In trying to maintain simplicity and consolidation while embracing a sprawl of interests, I leaned into the design pattern of changelogs and activity feeds. Time itself becomes a method of organization.

The site design, content, and purpose was largely influenced by [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/){:target="_blank"}, and [Julian Lehr](https://julian.digital/){:target="_blank"}. -->

The site is built primarily with HTML, CSS, and Markdown. Preprocessed by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} and hosted using Github pages. It leverages Markdown allowing relatively simple publishing. The sans serif typeface is [Inter UI by Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/){:target="_blank"} and the serif is [Roboto Mono by Christian Robertson](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono){:target="_blank"}.
