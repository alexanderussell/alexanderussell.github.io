Most of us view technology as something that makes things easier. Sometimes however, technology makes new things possible.

The QIS app empowers Services Professionals to work more efficently so they can provide better care for their clients.

# My Role

I was part of <a href="http://collectivelymade.com" target="_blank">a small team of collaborators</a> that assembled to invent and deliver a solution. I was responsible for the user-research, interaction design, and visual design for ‘QIS’—a web‑based application for ILC (Integrated Life Choices).

# The Challenge

#### Handling & compiling data

Integrated Life Choices approached us to help them excel in their ability to aquire and manipulate data related to their practice. This involved designing a mobile app that could be used on location to obtain data and designing a web platform that could interface with that data.

# The Approach

#### Interviews & Personas

Our lack of domain knowledge in service care and quality assurance data meant we needed to understand the nature of care service provision thoroughly and quickly.

Throughout the project we conducted a series of interviews all using prodding questions about current strategies and workflows. This approach was necessary to understand the reasoning process a typical user from ILC might use. It was also our only available due to the confidential nature of the non-profit's work.

This allowed us to quickly understand the day-to-day challenges of service professionals and managers. From these results, we created personas. A persona could give us a glimpse into who might be using which tool and how the tool can enhance their ability to do their job.

# The Discovery

#### ILCs Need More than just Info

Insights from our discovery work indicated many areas where a web-based solution could help to improve the day-to-day lives of service professionals, as well as create value in it's ability to digitally store data in order to keep records and manipulate & analyze data.

We discovered that whilst Form information was essential, it was only one dimension in providing effective care for clients.

If we truly wanted to make a difference to the lives of rural AHPs we needed to provide a more holistic solution that considered our users needs relating to:

support with the AT prescription process
access to resources for professional development
professional support and networking
These insights began pointing to a web-based solution with the ILC NSW AT database at the core.

Our vision was to create a collaborative environment that allowed AHPs to evaluate the benefits and limitations of different types of AT. With the AT database at the heart, we envisioned an evidence-based review and discussion system that allowed AHPs to share their experiences and learn from each other.

# User FLow

Although our vision was to create an environment for a community of AHPs, we discovered that there were too many obstacles that impacted our development timelines to tackle the problem.

Our research highlighted that it was critical for our design to be pragmatic and sensitive to the ways in which AHPs worked. We knew that if our solution required heavy time investment from AHPs or didn't provide an easily perceived tangible benefit, it would fail.

Subsequently, we sharpened our focus to assist rural AHPs:

access AT information in more effective ways
step through the clinical reasoning process
better manage clinical documentation
continue learning through educational media content

Technical Requirements

For our rural audience we needed to develop a solution that worked effectively on low-bandwidth connections. Website analytics also revealed that 20% of the traffic browsed the ILC NSW website using Internet Explorer 6. We embraced these constraints from the outset and opted to strive for a simpler and accessible solution.

# Scenarios

Before starting any design, we spent a great deal of time making sense of workflows and existing content. This involved a ton of task analysis and card sorting work.

# Sketching Interfaces

Instead of formally wireframing, I opted to sketch on paper. I used paper prototyping techniques to bring the designs to life and evaluate them with our users. This helped me work rapidly and led me to consider more ideas & validate them in interviews. Sketching many concepts helped me form a broader view of the system earlier ensuring a more cohesive design.

# Mockups

To move forward with the design I used Sketch to create sets of detailed mockups. I also used Principle and FramerJS to prototype interactions that became difficult to explain. This approach was beneficial in showing stakeholders design ideas, but was too time consuming to have a meaningful impact on the end product. At a certain point, so much style decisions were already in place, that simple sketches or wireframes were sufficent enough to communicate with the developer.

# Prototyping and Usability Testing

I worked closely with the developer to bring our designs to life as a working prototype. Communicating requirements face-to-face and discussing constraints and possibilities was an effective way of solving the Interaction Design. We were worked collaboratively, tested constantly and iterated progressively.
