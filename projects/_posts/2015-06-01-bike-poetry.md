This was built using an <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/1UxYccn">Arduino Leonardo</a> and a few supplies from the hardware store. The idea is that whenever the magnet gets close to the hall effect sensor, it reads a value which is translated through the arduino to turn on a light. The faster the tire is rotating the faster the light blinks.

The LED originally was in the center of the handle bars, facing the rider so he can receive visual feedback of how fast he is moving. Upon further consideration, I’ve decided to wire in two LED’s that extend to the ends of each handle bar. Doing this would make the LED light visible to drivers and thus make the cyclist more noticeable. It would also allow drivers to see a change in speed.
