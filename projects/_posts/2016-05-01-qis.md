Most of us view technology as something that makes things easier. Sometimes however, technology makes new things possible.

The Quality Improvement Solutions (QIS) app helps organizations in Health and Human Services (HHS) be more efficient with compliance tasks by replacing paper based processes with digital tools.

# My Role

I was part of <a href="http://collectivelymade.com" target="_blank">a small team of collaborators</a> that assembled to invent and deliver a solution. I was responsible for the user-research, interaction design, and visual design for ‘QIS’—a web‑based application for ILC (Integrated Life Choices).

# The Challenge

#### Handling & compiling data

Integrated Life Choices approached us to help them excel in their ability to acquire and manipulate data related to their practice. This involved designing a mobile app that could be used on location to obtain data and designing a web platform that could interface with that data. 

# The Discovery

#### Goals, Capabilities, & Features

To properly identify what we needed to build we used abstraction laddering techniques. We started with a very abstract "Goal" of the product and moved further into a concrete solution by breaking down capabilities of stakeholders. From those capabilities, we could start identifying features to be built.

<img src="../img/Process.png">

You can navigate your way down the ladder (ie: from a goal to a capability) by asking 'How?'. Likewise, you navigate your way up the ladder by asking 'Why?'.

An element is the smallest piece and the most concrete. Elements are things like buttons, paragraphs, links, etc. A collection of elements comprise a component. Multiple components working together become a feature. Multiple features work together to achieve a capability. Capabilities are abilities stakeholders must have in order to meet their goals.

So let's break this project down:

## Goal

The purpose of this project is to support the activities of ILC staff that improve the quality of life of their clients. The Quality Improvement (QI) goals they have set to help fulfill this purpose are:

1. to increase the number of potential QI opportunities that get identified,
2. to increase the number of approved QI opportunities that get completed, and
3. to reduce the amount of time needed between identifying and completing QIs.

The following are the capabilities that ILC staff need to have to achieve these goals.

## Capabilities

* _Collecting Information_ - need the ability to collect data
* _Securing Information_  - need the ability to assure the security of the data collected
* _Viewing Performance_ - need the ability to view and analyze the data
* _Reporting Findings_ - need the ability to export and share the data
* _Monitoring QI_ - need the ability to identify quality improvement opportunities
* _Maintaining System_ - need the ability to assure the quality of the system and guarantee access
* _Empowering Customers_ - need the ability to obtain and empower new customers

# The Approach

#### Interviews & Personas

Throughout the project we conducted a series of interviews all using prodding questions about current strategies and workflows. This approach was necessary to understand the reasoning process a typical user from ILC might use. It was also our only available due to the confidential nature of the non-profit's work.

This allowed us to quickly understand the day-to-day challenges of service professionals and managers. From these results, we created personas. A persona could give us a glimpse into the kind of user that might be using a tool and how that tool could enhance their ability to do their job.

# Sketching Interfaces

#### User Flow & User Interface

Instead of formally wireframing, I opted to sketch them on paper. I used paper prototyping techniques to bring the designs to life and evaluate them with our users. This helped me work rapidly and led me to consider more ideas & validate them in interviews. Sketching also gave me an opportunity to visual the user flow and quickly problem solve by observing how a user would interact with the structures I was creating.

# Mockups & Scenarios

I used Sketch to create hi fidelity mockups to validate the product with stakeholders and act as a visual reference for development. Below are UI mocks for the mobile app.

In order to effectively communicate with the developer, I laid out powerpoint slides that broke down the design decisions from the abstract capability that was being served to the concrete interface. The slides walk through each component, explaining the UI and outlining the constraints for the interaction. 

Scenarios were a great way to use language to create constraints on the design. I wrote constraints in the 'Given X, When Y, Then Z' form. Using these constraints, our developer knew how elements were supposed to work, and could write test that validated each scenario.

One of these was created for each feature we developed. Below is an example from the Data Viewer feature:

<div class="carousel-single">
    <div>
        <img class="carousel-images" src="../img/work/QIS/scenarios/data-viewer-scenarios.jpeg">
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class="carousel-images" src="../img/work/QIS/scenarios/data-viewer-scenarios 2.jpeg">
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class="carousel-images" src="../img/work/QIS/scenarios/data-viewer-scenarios 3.jpeg">
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class="carousel-images" src="../img/work/QIS/scenarios/data-viewer-scenarios 4.jpeg">

    <div>
        <img class="carousel-images" src="../img/work/QIS/scenarios/data-viewer-scenarios 5.jpeg">
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class="carousel-images" src="../img/work/QIS/scenarios/data-viewer-scenarios 6.jpeg">
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class="carousel-images" src="../img/work/QIS/scenarios/data-viewer-scenarios 7.jpeg">
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class="carousel-images" src="../img/work/QIS/scenarios/data-viewer-scenarios 8.jpeg">
    </div>
    <div>
        <img class="carousel-images" src="../img/work/QIS/scenarios/data-viewer-scenarios 9.jpeg">
    </div>
</div>

I also used Principle and FramerJS to crudely prototype interactions that became difficult to explain. This approach was beneficial in showing stakeholders design ideas for validation, or for explaining animations to our developer.

        <img class="carousel-images" src="../img/work/QIS/animations/formsubmitter-scan.gif">

    <div>
        <img class="carousel-images" src="../img/work/QIS/animations/add-metric.gif">
    </div>
</div>

# Prototyping and Usability Testing

I worked closely with the developer to bring our designs to life as a working prototype. Communicating requirements face-to-face and discussing constraints and possibilities with the aide of the slides I created was an effective way of solving the Interaction Design. We were worked collaboratively, tested constantly and iterated progressively.
